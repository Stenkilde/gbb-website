Our 18 holes course is a par 72 course, with a length of 63xx metres from tee 63, 59xx metres from tee 59, 55xx metres from tee 55 and 49xx metres from tee 49. For the gentlemen (tee 59) the course rating is 71,6 and slope 128. For the ladies (tee 49) the course rating is 72,0 and slope 122, The present course record from Tee 63 is 65 strokes (Niklas Nørgård Møller, KG) and from Tee 59 it is 64 strokes (Nigel Willett, our head Pro) <br><br> Our course is known as a very charming park course, on a lightly undulating, open country ground with varied vegetation and big old trees, and winding around famous Kokkedal Castle. From some holes you will be overlooking Oeresund, the narrow waters between Denmark and Sweden. The course may at first glance seem easy, but do not be mistaken, It is varied from hole to hole, each rich of challenges and requiring tactic and precision strokes. Fairways are fairly wide, and with several bunkers strategically well placed, and thus making our course guide a good helping hand, if you strive for an acceptable score.",

Our greens are fast, and some of which quite undulated, so putting requires reading of the green and determination. All in all a challenging course but fair for both high and low handicappers. <br> <br> Between hole 9 and 10 you will find a halfway house with toilet and beverage vending machine <br> <br> Further to our exciting course we offer a comfortable and lovely lounge-realaxed type club house with modern locker facilities for both ladies and gentlemen, and a well assorted pro shop, offering everything within golf equipment as Pro-training as well as rent of equipment, trollies and buggies <br> <br> At Golf & Business Butler administration, we are honoured and very please to work with Kokkedal Golf Club, often hosting 3-5 matches a year at this gem of a North Sealand Golf Club. <br> <br> Kokkedal GC welcome your visit, and hope you will have a pleasant and great golf experience."

Apart from the splendid sea view, players are surrounded by pine and olive groves throughout their round and, even though a young course, Alcanada is already recognised by a number of well known golf magazines and golf guides as one of the finest courses in Spain and Europe — including being named the best course in Europe by leading German magazine Golf Journal for the fourth year in a row in 2012.",
